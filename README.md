3.	MNIST Image Compression: Dimensionality Reduction using SVD, Visualization
Hands-on experience with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and applied it to the MNIST dataset for image compression.

5.	Housing Price Prediction: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression
Demonstrated Linear Regression to predict house prices by measuring the correlation between the regression model & dependent variable. Estimated the true hidden value in the data by relating the dependent variable with the independent variable using polynomial regression.

6.	8- Queenâ€™s Problem: Genetic Algorithm
Performed Genetic Algorithm to find the true solution to optimize the problem using an Evolutionary Algorithm (inheritance, mutation, selection, crossover, & recombination)
